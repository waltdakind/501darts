# 501darts

Look up recommended outs for a given number in '01 based dart games.

Display the "outs" (combination of targets to reach zero with the last dart being a double) for a given number.

Motivation for this is that most out charts don't display well on my phone. 

Out charts that are the basis of these recommendations can be found at [3 Dart Outs -- Dartbase](http://www.dartbase.com/outchart1.htm)
and [2 Dart Outs  -- Dartbase](http://www.dartbase.com/outchart2.htm), other good advice, articles about darts, and dart supplies can be found there too.
