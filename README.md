# 501darts
Calculate outs for a given number in '01 based dart games.
Display the "outs" (number combination to reach zero) for a given number based on doubling out 
(also calculate based on triple out possibility, for which there aren't many out charts readily available).

//TODO add option for no double bullseye


Motivation for this is that most out charts don't display well on my phone and don't include tripling out options. Seems like a good exercise in using some of the ES2015 syntax.
