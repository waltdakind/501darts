# 501darts

Look up recommended outs for a given number in '01 based dart games.

Display the "outs" (number combination to reach zero) for a given number based on doubling out.

Motivation for this is that most out charts don't display well on my phone and don't include tripling out options. 


Out charts can be found at [http://www.dartbase.com/outchart1.htm]
and [http://www.dartbase.com/outchart2.htm], other good advice, articles about darts, and dart supplies can be found there too.
